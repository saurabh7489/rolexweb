<p>In 1931, Rolex patented a self-winding mechanism called a Perpetual rotor, a semi-circular plate that relies on gravity to move freely. In turn, the Oyster watch became known as the Oyster Perpetual. The invention of the Perpetual rotor by Rolex in 1931 revolutionized the self-winding watch, as watches were previously not allowed to be wound[why?][clarification needed] using a semi-circular plate that moved freely with gravity.

From 1935 until 1945, Rolex produced special diving watches for the Italian underwater demolition teams of the Decima Flottiglia MAS. These watches were distributed through the Italian Rolex retailer Orologeria Svizzera belonging to G. Panerai & Figlio in Florence. During World War II, Italy was part of the Axis powers and fought against the British. Members of the Italian Decima Flottiglia MAS damaged and sunk several British ships, including two important battleships, the Valiant and the Queen Elizabeth. In 1944, a large quantity of these Rolex-made watches (around 1000 pieces) were supplied to German Kampfschwimmers, who had been trained by the reconstituted Decima Flottiglia MAS under Junio Valerio Borghese following the Armistice of Cassibile in which Italy surrendered to the Allies.

In mid 1941, Hans Wilsdorf, who had become a British citizen in 1911, was investigated by the security police of the Canton of Geneva after the British had voiced concerns that he was a Nazi sympathizer. The inquiry concluded:

"The information gathered shows that Wilsdorf is a fervent admirer of the Hitler regime. He does not hide his satisfaction when events favourable to Germany occur. However, we have not seen or heard of any pro-Hitler propaganda or suspicious activity on his part. The above-mentioned person is not unfavourably known to our judicial services and has not been convicted in our town. From a political point of view, Wilsdorf is known to our services as a 'Nazi'. A check of his correspondance was carried out in 1940, but nothing suspicious was found at the time."</p>
